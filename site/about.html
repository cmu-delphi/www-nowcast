        <p class="text_header"><i class="fa fa-gears"></i> How Does ILI-Nearby Work?</p>
<p class="text_content">
We use sensor fusion theory to optimally combine, in real-time, diverse sources of information about the prevalence of Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) in various geographic areas of the US.  These sources, enumerated below, vary in their geographic granularity (metro areas, U.S. states, multi-state regions, entire US), their temporal granularity (daily or weekly), their noise (error) characteristics, and their correlation with one another.
</p>
<p class="text_content" id="HOW_ACCURATE">
We estimate a <i style="color:#87CEFA">geographically detailed joint distribution</i> of ILI prevalence over the entire US, which we then integrate over to derive real-time nowcasts for any desired geographic area.  This means that even an information source that is available only at a national or regional level contributes indirectly to the accuracy of nowcasting a state.  <i style="color:#87CEFA">All information sources benefit all of our estimates, but to different degrees in different circumstances</i> (to see how the information sources contribute to nowcasting for a particular geographic area, hover over the icons representing these sources.)  Our combined estimate is significantly more accurate than estimates based on any one of the sources alone.
</p>
<p class="text_content" >
We continuously monitor the correlations of the information sources and use them to estimate (again in real-time) a covariance matrix.  This helps us avoid over- or under- estimation when the errors of two or more sources are correlated.
</p>
         <p class="text_header" ><i class="fa fa-dashboard"></i> How accurate is ILI-Nearby?</p>
<p class="text_content">
As Gold Standard for national and regional weighted ILI, we use the CDC-reported 'final' values, typically defined as the values available at epi-week 30 (late July – well after the end of the flu season!).  This is because updates continue to arrive many months after each initial report.  ILI-Nearby overlays the gold standard (black line) on its own historical nowcasts (which are done “out of sample”, without knowledge of anything that wasn’t known at nowcasting time), from which you can assess its historical accuracy.
</p>

<p class="text_content">
In addition, the following visualizations summarize the historical out-of-sample percent (absolute) error of ILI-Nearby, alongside that of Delphi’s near-term forecasts (available a few weeks earlier) and CDC’s ILI-Net initial report and later reports (available a few weeks later).  The percent error helps put errors from different locations and parts of the season on the same scale: for example, an estimate of 3.6 when the ground truth is 3.0 has a percent error of 20% (|3.0-3.6|/3.0 = 0.2), the same as when the estimate is 1.8 and the ground truth is 1.5.   From these visualizations you can see the tradeoff between accuracy and timeliness offered by Delphi’s nowcasts and forecasts:

<p class="text_content">
As Gold Standard for fitting the US states’ %ILI, we use the best stable estimate available from each state.  Twenty five states graciously agreed to share with us the %ILI data they sent to the CDC.  Forty three states post a version of their %ILI data online, which we scrape and combine with the CDC-provided data when both are available.  Only 5 states do not fall in either of these categories, and thus lack a gold standard.  However, their nowcasts still benefit from the data of their neighboring states and regions.
</p>
<p class="text_content">
<b style="color:#87CEFA">CAVEAT:  %ILI numbers are not meaningfully comparable across different states or regions.</b>  This is because each state's ILINet consists of a different mix of healthcare provider types (hospital emergency departments, pediatric clinics, family practices, student health centers, etc.), and different provider types have different typical rates of seeing ILI patients.  We are currently working to derive measures that will be more meaningfully comparable across states and regions.

The Wikimedia Foundation makes available the number of visits (“hits”), per hour, to every Wikipedia article. There is a strong correlation between wILI in the US and the number of hits to English articles related to influenza.  This allowed us to develop an ILI-related signal.  We currently have no access to any geographic information associated with Wikipedia access.  This reduces the usefulness of the signal, but we are able to compensate somewhat by considering the time of day (or night) of access.
