This is the NowCasting site of Influenza-Like Illness by the <a href="http://delphi.midas.cs.cmu.edu/">DELPHI</a> Group at Carnegie Mellon University. We focus on developing the technological capability of epidemiological forecasting, and its role in decision making, both public and private.

Epidemiologists, clinicians, and public health policy makers together face a serious and unique challenge: at any given point in time, the true extent of a disease outbreak is not fully known - perhaps even unknowable. It is desirable, advantageous, and profitable to have accurate and timely situational awareness in order to prepare for, and to mitigate the effects of disease outbreaks.

This site is our effort to produce that timeliness. With the explosive growth of the internet and of the number of individuals with internet access, We can now use digital surveillance data to produce REAL-TIME nowcasts of influenza activity in the US. This site shows both our current and historical nowcasts.
